- To add new items I have created a uploadData function in FirestoreDB class under data->network folder, add as per your need for now just using static data, but it gets saved in the firestore.
- To verify the data being stored in the firestore please simple create a project of your preferred name and 
uncomment the line number 23 in splash screen so the data gets inserted into the firestore
- For statemanagement, I have used Cubit  and the basic functionality is done but the filters and some not yet, I hope you will get a glimse of my work.
- Thank you
